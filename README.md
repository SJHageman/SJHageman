# Physics

## Writing samples
 - Link to [my PhD dissertation](https://github.com/SJHageman/Dissertation/blob/master/SJH-dissertation.pdf), which details an experimental technique that I developed (Complex Attosecond Transient-absorption Spectroscopy).
 - Link to [my candidacy exam](https://github.com/SJHageman/Candidacy_Paper/blob/main/SJH_candidacy_paper.pdf), which is a report on the experimental observation of Efimov states in an ultracold atomic gas.
